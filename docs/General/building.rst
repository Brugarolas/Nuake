How to build
==================
Building Nuake is currently the only supported way to get Nuake.
This means that you will need to build the projects file, build, then launch the project.

The following step should help you get Nuake running on your computer:
   #. Clone the git repo and the submodules recursivly. 
      This can be done using the following command::

      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/antopilo/Nuake.git

   #. Launch the cmd file called `generate.bat`.
      This should generate a visual studio solution for you.

   #. Build the project, everything should build in the right order and launch the editor.
