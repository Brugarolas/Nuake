Welcome to the offical documentation of Nuake, an open-source 3D game engine!
Nuake is a 3D game engine aimed to create games similar to quake with modern technologies.
The recent resurgence of quake-like games gave me the initial ideas to create an engine designed
to make those types of games. This means that integration of tools like trenchbroom and quake-based tools
will be a priority during the development of Nuake.



What is Nuake?
============
Nuake is a work-in-progress game engine aimed to give a simple but flexible tool to create quake-type games. 


What type of game is it for?
============
You can create any type of game using Nuake, but it is mostly designed to create 3D games.
You should be able to create FPS or TPS games without problems, although it was originally designed to create first person games.
