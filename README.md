# What is it
Nuake is a game engine written from scratch by myself. It is not meant to be a end-all be-all engine and it is not a quakespasm type engine. This is a game engine that focuses on fast level design iteration that integrates with quake level editing software. If you can create quake maps, you can create Nuake levels. 
`Warning: It is still very early in development and I dont recommend anyone using this to make their games *yet*. `

# How to build
1. Clone the repos using `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/antopilo/Nuake.git`
2. Run the `generate.bat` to generate the sln files.
3. Open `Nuake.sln`
4. Build and run
